Shows all posts from a category/tag into a page/post with order support.

== Description ==

It's an easy way to show and order all posts from category/tag into a page/post. Really handy for showing your tutorials, articles, etcetera.
It shows as a list(&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;) so it will apply your blog style-sheet as you wish.

<strong>Note:</strong> If the selected term(category or tag) has a description, it will be shown in a &lt;blockquote&gt; tag.

To see it in action click [here](http://felipetonello.com/blog/tutoriais-e-artigos/ "Felipe Tonello blog").

Usage:

1. Go to Category Show's options page and generate the tag.

2. Insert your new tag into your post.

Tags to know:

If you want to apply some CSS, those are the tags you should know: <strong>&lt;h3&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;ul&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;li&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;a&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;blockquote&gt;</strong>.

Output example:

	<h3>Category</h3>
	<blockquote>Category description, if exists</blockquote>
	<ul>
	<li><a title="link title" rel="bookmark" href="link">title</a></li>
	</ul>


That's it!
